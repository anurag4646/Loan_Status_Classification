# Loan_Status_Classification

## Problem Statement
The Bank Indessa has not done well in the last 3 quarters. Their NPAs (Non Performing Assets) have reached all time high. It is starting to lose the confidence of its investors. As a result, itâ€™s stock has fallen by 20% in the previous quarter alone.
After careful analysis, it was found that the majority of NPA was contributed by loan defaulters. With the messy data collected over all the years, this bank has decided to use machine learning to figure out a way to find these defaulters and devise a plan to reduce them.
This bank uses a pool of investors to sanction their loans. For example: If any customer has applied for a loan of $20000, along with the bank, the investors perform due diligence on the requested loan application. Keep this in mind while understanding data.

- This task is based on calssification problem ( Imbalanced Target - 0 - 76% and 1- 23% aprox ). 
- Here are the submission of best 2 models that is - CatBoost Classifier and LightGBM.  
- Comparision of ROC AUC score -

- Both the models works well. 
- there are 2 submission file - use - "catboost_submission.csv" 
- The prediction is based on probability scores - loan_amount > 0.5 is Defaulter(1) and loan_amount < 0.5 is Non Defaulters(0).
